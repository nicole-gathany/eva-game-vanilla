# eva-game-vanilla

Going to try to make Eva's game with Vanilla Javascript first because I am not sure react is necessary and the svg files are not working

## Game Premise

Basically she asked me to create a game where there are a whole bunch of little balls of different colors. The user is given a ball of a certain color and if the user presses the button, the ball shoot towards the collection of balls. If the ball hits ball of the same color, the balls of that color disappear and the user gets points awarded to them based on the number of balls that disappear.

## Steps

I am writing these steps before I start the app so that I can plan what I want to do.

- [x] Create balls
- [x] Most of the balls should be at the top of the page
- [x] Make the balls 2-3 random colors from a selection of 5 colors, but clustered around balls of the same color.
- [x] Create animation that propels one ball from the right bottom of the page to the group of balls.
- [ ] Make the group of balls disappear if the color of the ball that is propelled hits the group of balls of the same color. (only works for yellow and green so far but with many lines of code. I need to see if I can reduce the number of lines of code by controlling the colors by class)
- [ ] Maybe the user ball can be moved based on where the mouse is and then be propelled that way?
- [ ] Make the ball move with cursor at the right side of the page and the bottom of the page
- [ ] Make more balls across the page
- [ ] I think I actually want the random ball to fall back down after hitting the balls it makes disappear

## Animations

After reading about SVG files, I am interested in potentially using them for the game.
It's possible that I can just use HTML and CSS. We'll see.
